## Config

These are dotfiles, there are many like it but these are mine.

The goal is to make it easy to setup a work VM with all my customizations as i often code at work, and i only have access to an android phone or tablet.\
The dotfiles may work for you but i do not recommend installing them anywhere except in a VM

### Bootstrap

```
$ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandorex/config/master/bootstrap/bootstrap.sh | bash -s
```

### Installation

Installation is simple, just run `install.sh` script from the **root of repository** (`./bash/install.sh` for example) and the bash configuration will be linked
