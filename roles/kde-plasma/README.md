# KDE Plasma

## Keybindings
The keybindings i use as i tend to forget to set them up until i need it

- `Shift + Super + UP` Maximize window

Custom scripts (prefix all commands with `systemd-cat --` so its debuggable from journal)

- `Super + H` Headphones toggle (`~/.bin/toggle-audio-sink ...`)
- `Super + Alt + M` Dual monitor toggle (`~/.bin/toggle-monitor-kscreen ...`)
