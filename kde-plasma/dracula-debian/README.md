# dracula-debian
This theming is based on Dracula Solid KDE theme, these are or will be modified to my own preferences

## Modifications
These are modifications done to the themes, beware this may not be up to date

- Debian look and feel theme's splash screen has been modified to show pulsing debian logo instead of the original bat thingy
- Dracula-Solid desktop theme has been modified to highlight open applications in task manager, which has been a huge annoyance for me
